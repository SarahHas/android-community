*Willowtree* 
Willowtree is an app development firm that created an app to find potential hires.  If you go to the Google Play store and search for Willowtree Easter Eggs, it will come up.  Students are allowed to do whatever it takes (decompile, change code, recompile…whatever) to solve the 10 public challenges and the 7 hidden ones.  The only thing they can’t do is go into the code and mark that they solved the challenges.  They have to actually solve them.
