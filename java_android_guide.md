# Women Who Code DC Java Resources

** First monday of the month - beginner meetup

### Suggested Learning Tools
You will get the most out of our meetups if you follow one of our suggested resources. These are the classes/books/resources that our members know the best and can offer the most support for.

We will not assist with work problems. We are here to help you learn the skills that will help you solve work problems, but asking about work related problems derails the productivity of everyone at the event. Repeated requests for solutions to work problems will result in our leaders asking you to leave.

**Beginner**   

* [Become an Android Developer from Scratch](https://www.udemy.com/become-an-android-developer-from-scratch/?dtcode=TPTbIQE29HVW) 
* [Head First Java](http://www.amazon.com/Head-First-Java-2nd-Edition/dp/0596009208/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1400022857&sr=8-1&keywords=head+first+java) (no previous coding experience)

**Intermediate** (you need to have previous java experience)   

* [Coursera Android Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specialization/mobilecloudcomputing2/36?utm_medium=listingPage)

((Actually maybe we will just follow [CodePath](http://guides.codepath.com/android)))

### Alternate Resources

We have also compiled a lot of resources that may or may not be useful for learning Java and/or Android. Some members may have experience with the resources - but we cannot guarantee assistance at our meetups. Members will get priority help if they have questions related to the above resources.
