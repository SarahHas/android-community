#Welcome to Android Labs

##What are Android Labs?

Android Labs is a community within Women Who Code that focuses primarily on
learning how to program on the android mobile application development platform and strengthening skills in java.

##Current Projects: Collaborative App Making - Resume App

We are currently working on building an app from the ground up (no experience needed). This app will allow users to modify their resumes to better reflect job postings

###Acceptance Criteria

We are aiming towards building an app that does the following:

* Greeting - A welcome message for user
* Input Job Posting Text - Where a user can easily link or paste job description
* Upload Resume
* Output Percentage Matching - Show matching percentage between resume and job description
* Job Posting Keywords - Extract keywords from job posting
* Preview of Possible Changes - User can review new resume before accepting changes
* Grammar Check
* Formatting Check
* Check job posting for additional application steps
